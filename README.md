## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

      W3schools: javascript syntax, css colors, web safe fonts, html img tag, html syntax, css syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
      
      My biggest challenge was getting accustomed to the syntax of the various languages. As a person who mainly worked in back end languages before and only had a slight familiarity with front end languages, I did not want to simply go through the instructions/guide for the sake of completing it. Instead, I wanted to fully understand the languages as well as the similarities and differences between them so that I am better aware of the capabilities of each one. At one point in the project, I encountered a problem with the sound in my program. The problem was that while the code seemingly was fine the sound would not work consistently. Only after closely observing my syntax I was able to realize that the problem was because of the variable syntax. Overall I felt that after understanding what each language does, I was able to really understand how each language in the project interact with each other. I am looking forward to discovering the various ways different languages communicate information between each other and the result that comes out of it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

      During the time I spent on my submission, I was constantly amazed about the capabilities of the front end languages involved. Front end languages go beyond just the normal font and context, and are an ultimate tool to transform our ideas about how we would imagine the most ideal user experience to be like and puts them into motion. After finishing up this project, I am curious to see the extent of which a program’s functionalities are heightened through the combination of back end and front end development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   If I had more time to work on this project I would utilize that time to implement additional features for the game. The first thing I would work on is the timer/clock that displays as well as limits the amount of time the player has to guess the sequence. I think it would be a great addition to the game overall as it would raise the difficulty while being a useful feature for the player to be aware of during the game. Another set of features I would like implement in the game are modes such as easy, medium, and hard. Through this variety the player would be able to choose the difficulty they are comfortable with.
